It is recommended to either use jupyter lab or VSCode for working with ipynb. You can use jupyter lab or VSCode if you are familiar with using them and and comfortable with installing and managing them but not mandatory for solving the assignments

Jupyter-lab can be installed in the `uitai` environment using: `pip install jupyterlab`

Launching vscode from the `uitai` can help you choose the required python environment conveniently.
